    openDAQ: SDK by Dewesoft and HBK that bridges the gap between test and measurement devices in an era where incompatibility is the norm
</h3>

---

openDAQ is a software development kit that allows for easy integration of test and measurement devices into its ecosystem. It provides a simple API that 
allows users to connect to openDAQ devices, configure their properties, and read their measurement data. The SDK also contains a framework
for developing custom signal processing blocks that process and analyze signal data. In a world where test and measurement devices cannot
communicate, openDAQ provides a common language for all to speak.

## Features

- Simple connection to openDAQ-enabled devices, allowing for property visualization/configuration and data streaming.
- Simple integration of existing test and measurement devices into the openDAQ ecosystem.
- SDK that runs the same code on both the device (server) and application (client).
- Signal processing framework that allows for implementation of custom data processing blocks that run on any SDK instance (device or application).
- OPC UA for structure/property transfer, WebSocket streaming for data.
- API built of C-compatible interfaces that can be passed across shared libraries with C++ wrappers that ease the complexity of working with interfaces.
- Wrappers for Python and Delphi (C# in development).

## Getting started

- [Downloads ‚Üí](https://docs.opendaq.com)
- [User documentation ‚Üí](https://opendaq.github.io/)
- [API documentation (Doxgen) ‚Üí](https://docs.opendaq.com/doxygen/index.html)

## Documentation

The Doxygen documentation can be built by enabling the OPENDAQ_BUILD_DOCUMENTATION cmake flag. The user guide
documentation can be built with Antora by following the guide found in docs/Antora/README.md.

### Required tools before building

 - CMake 3.24 or higher: https://cmake.org/ (might come with development environment like Visual Studio)
 - Git: https://git-scm.com/
 - Compiler:
   - (msvc) Visual Studio 2017 or higher with installed Workload for C++
   - (gcc windows) MSYS2: http://www.msys2.org, https://github.com/msys2/msys2/wiki/MSYS2-installation
   - (gcc) Ninja build system: https://ninja-build.org/
   - Python3: https://www.python.org/downloads/
 - (optional) Boost C++ Library: https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/ , http://theboostcpplibraries.com
   - If installed, set CMake option `OPENDAQ_ALWAYS_FETCH_BOOST=OFF` to allow the SDK to use it.
   - See also document [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).
   
### Building on Windows

#### 1. Install all required tools / packages.

See [Required tools before building](#required-tools-before-building) above.

#### 2. Clone openDAQ repo.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:openDAQ/openDAQ.git
cd openDAQ
```

#### 3. Generate CMake project for specific compiler / preset.

In the repository root folder execute the following command to list available presets
then select the one that fits you and generate CMake project:
```shell
cmake --list-presets=all
cmake --preset "x64/msvc-22/full"
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è If for any reason there is no preset for your compiler (version) you can list the "CMake generators" and
> specify one to override the closest preset (e.g. to use Visual Studio 2019):
> ```shell
> cmake -G
> cmake --preset "x64/msvc-17/full" -G "Visual Studio 16 2019"
> ```

#### 4. Build the project

Open and build `build/x64/msvc-22/full/openDAQ.sln` using Visual Studio (if one ``msvc`` preset had been used above).

Or use command line:
```shell
# build from repository root
cmake --build build/x64/msvc-22/full
# or move to build directory
cd build/x64/msvc-22/full
cmake --build .
```

For other compilers than ``msvc`` one can add parameter ``-j 4`` to the build command to specify the number of parallel builds
(see _cmake.org_: [Build a Project with CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.24/manual/cmake.1.html#build-a-project)).

### Building on Linux

#### 1. Install all required tools / packages.

For example in Ubuntu
```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y git build-essential lld cmake ninja-build mono-complete python3
```

#### 2. Clone openDAQ repo.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:openDAQ/openDAQ.git
cd openDAQ
```

#### 3. Generate CMake project for specific compiler / preset.

In the repository root folder execute the following command to list available presets
then select the one that fits you and generate CMake project:
```shell
cmake --list-presets=all
cmake --preset "x64/gcc/full/debug"
```

#### 4. Build the project.

```shell
# build from repository root
cmake --build build/x64/gcc/full/debug
# or move to build directory
cd build/x64/gcc/full/debug
cmake --build .
```

More information about advanced building options can be found in [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) document.
