 * @brief An ownable object can have IPropertyObject as the owner.
 *
 * An object can declare itself ownable. When a parent object that supports a concept of ownership
 * calls the` setOwner` method, it becomes the owner of the object. It's up to the object's implementation
 * to decide what actions should it forward to the owner.
 *
 * For example, a property object that is a child of another property object will look up property values 
 * in their owner's dictionary if the property is not set locally.
