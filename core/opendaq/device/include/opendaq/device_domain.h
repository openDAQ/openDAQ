 * @brief Contains information about the domain of the device.
 *
 * The device domain contains a general view into the device's domain data. While devices most often operate
 * in the time domain, this interface allows for description of any other domain commonly used in signal processing.
 * For example, common domains include the angle domain, frequency domain, the spatial domain, and the wavelet domain.
 *
 * The device domain allows for users to query a device for its current domain value via `getTicksSinceOrigin`
 * and convert that into its domain unit by multiplying the tick count with the resolution. To get the absolute
 * domain value, we can then also add the value to the Origin, which is most often provided
 * as a time epoch in the ISO 8601 format.
 *
 * Note that all devices might note provide a device domain implementation. Such devices cannot be directly queried
 * for their domain data. In such a case, the domain data can be obtained through the device's output signals.
