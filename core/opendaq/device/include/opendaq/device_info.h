/*!
 * @brief Contains standard information about an openDAQ device and device type. The Device Info object is a
 * Property Object, allowing for custom String, Int, Bool, or Float-type properties to be added.
 *
 * The getter methods represent a standardized set of Device properties according to the
 * OPC UA: Devices standard. Any additional String, Int, Bool, or Float-type properties can be added, using the
 * appropriate Property Object "add property" method. Any other types of properties are invalid.
 * Although Integer-type properties are valid additions, Selection properties cannot be added to
 * Device Info.
 *
 * As the Device Info object adheres to the OPC UA: Devices standard, it behaves differently than
 * standard Property Objects. No metadata except the Value Type and Default Value are published
 * via OPC UA, and this only said Property metadata is visible to any clients.
 *
 * All fields - default (e.g. platform, manufacturer...) and custom are represented as either:
 *
 * - String-type properties
 * - Integer-type properties
 * - Bool-type properties
 * - Float type properties
 *
 * As such, listing all properties via Property Object methods, will return both the
 * names of the default and custom properties. All default properties are initialized to an empty
 * string except for RevisionCounter and Position that are integer properties and are
 * thus initialized to '0'. The names of the properties are written in camelCase - for
 * example "systemUuid", "parentMacAddress", "manufacturerUri".
 *
 * If the DeviceInfo object is obtained from a device, or when listing available devices, the
 * object is frozen (immutable). As such, Property Object setter methods cannot be used
 * and will fail when called.
