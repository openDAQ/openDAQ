 * @brief Provides an interface to manipulate the configuration of a device's (server's) network interface.
 * Offers methods to update the IP configuration and retrieve the currently active one, if the corresponding feature
 * supported by the device. Additionally, includes a helper method to create a prebuilt property object with valid default configuration.
 *
 * The configuration property object, passed as a parameter to said methods, should include the following properties:
 *
 * - **"dhcp4"**: A boolean property indicating whether DHCP is enabled for IPv4. Defaults to `True` (DHCP enabled).
 *   If set to `False` (DHCP disabled), non-empty static configuration properties are required.
 * - **"address4"**: A string property specifying the statically assigned IPv4 address in the format `address/netmask` (e.g. 192.168.1.2/24).
 *   This property is ignored when DHCP is enabled for IPv4. However, if DHCP is disabled, the list must include at least one address. Defaults to an empty string.
 * - **"gateway4"**: A string property specifying the IPv4 gateway address. This is required if DHCP is disabled and ignored otherwise. Defaults to an empty string.
 * - **"dhcp6"**, **"address6"**, **"gateway6"**: These properties follow the same format and rules as their IPv4 counterparts but apply to IPv6 configuration.
