 * @brief Describes the data sent by a signal, defining how they are to be interpreted by anyone receiving the signal's packets.
 *
 * The data descriptor provides all information required on how to process data buffers, and how to interpret the data.
 * It contains the following fields:
 *   - `Name`: A descriptive name of the data being described. In example, when the values describe the amplitude of spectrum data, the name
 *             would be `Amplitude`.
 *   - `Dimensions`: A list of dimensions of the signal. A sample descriptor can have 0 or more dimensions. A signal with 1 dimension
 *                   has vector data. A signal with 2 dimensions has matrix data, a signal with 0 has a single value for each sample.
 *   - `SampleType`: An enum value that specifies the underlying data type (eg. Float64, Int32, String,...)
 *   - `Unit`: The unit of the data in the signal's packets.
 *   - `ValueRange`: The value range of the data in a signal's packets defining the lowest and highest expected values. The range is not
 * enforced.
 *   - `Rule`: The data rule that defines how a signal value is calculated from an implicit initialization value when the rule type is not
 *             `Explicit`.
 *   - `Origin`: Defines the starting point of the signal. If set, all values are added to the absolute origin when read.
 *   - `TickResolution`: Used to scale signal ticks into their physical unit. In example, a resolution of 1/1000 with the unit being `seconds`
 *                       states that a value of 1 correlates to 1 millisecond.
 *   - `PostScaling`: Defines a scaling transformation, which should be applied to data carried by the signal's packets when read. If
 *                   `PostScaling` is used, the `Rule`, `Resolution`, and `Origin` must not be configured. The `SampleType` must match the
 *                   `outputDataType` of the `PostScaling`.
 *   - `StructFields`: A list of DataDescriptor. The descriptor list is used to define complex data samples. When defined, the sample
 *                     buffer is laid out so that the data described by the first DataDescriptor is at the start, followed by the data
 *                     described by the second and so on. If the list is not empty, all descriptor parameters except for `Name` and
 *                     `Dimensions` should not be configured. See below for a explanation of Structure data descriptors.
 *
 * @subsection data_descriptor_dimensions Dimensions
 * The list of dimensions determines the rank of values described by the descriptor. In example, if the list contains 1 dimension, the data
 * values are vectors. If it contains 2, the data values are matrices, if 0, the descriptor describes a single value.
 *
 * When the data is placed into packet buffers, the values are laid out in packet buffers linearly, where each value fills up
 * `sizeof(sampleType) * (dimensionSize1 * dimensionSize2 *...)` bytes.
 *
 * Data descriptor objects implement the Struct methods internally and are Core type `ctStruct`.
 * 
 * @subsection data_descriptor_struct_fields Struct fields
 *
 * A DataDescriptor with the `StructFields` field filled with other descriptors is used to represent signal data in the form of structures.
 * It allows for custom and complex structures to be described and sent by a signal.
 *
 * When evaluating a struct descriptor, their struct field values are laid out in the packet buffers in the order they are placed in
 * the `structFields` list. Eg. a struct with 3 fields, of types [int64_t, float, double] will have a buffer composed of an int64_t value,
 * followed by a float, and lastly a double value.
 *
 * Note that if the Dimensions field of the DataDescriptor is not empty, struct data can also be of a higher rank
 * (eg. a vector/matrix of structs).
 *
 * @subsection data_descriptor_calculation_order Value calculation
 * Besides the struct fields and dimensions, the Value descriptor also provides 4 fields which need to be taken into account and calculated
 * when reading packet buffers: `Rule`, `Resolution`, `Origin`, and `PostScaling`.
 *
 * @subsubsection data_descriptor_calculation_without_scaling Without `PostScaling`
 *
 * 1. Check and apply `Rule`:
 *    - If the rule is `explicit`, the values of a packet are present in the packet's data buffer
 *    - If not `explicit`, the packet's values need to be calculated. To calculate them, take the PacketOffset and SampleCount of the
 *      packet. Use the PacketOffset, as well as the index of the sample in a packet to calculate the rule's output value: `Value = PacketOffset + Rule(Index)`.
 *      Eg. `Value = PacketOffset + Delta * Index + Start`
 * 2. Apply `TickResolution`:
 *    - If the `TickResolution` is set, multiply the value from 1. with the `Resolution`. This scales the value into the `Unit` of the value
 *      descriptor.
 *    - If not set, keep the value from 1.
 * 3. Add `Origin`:
 *    - If the `Origin` is set, take the value from 2. and add it to the `Origin`.
 *      In example, if using the Unix Epoch, a value `1669279690` in seconds would mean Thursday, 24 November 2022 08:48:10 GMT.
 *    - If not set, keep the value from 2.
 *
 * @subsubsection data_descriptor_calculation_with_scaling With `PostScaling`
 *
 * If `PostScaling` is set, the `Rule` must be explicit, while `Resolution` and `Origin` must not be configured.
 *
 * To calculate the value with `PostScaling` configured, take the values of the packet's data buffer and apply the post scaling to each
 * value in the buffer: `Value = PostScaling(Value)`, eg. `Value = Value * Scale + Offset`
