 * @brief Interface representing a Synchronization Component in a Test & Measurement system.
 * A SynchronizationComponent ensures synchronization among measurement devices in the system.
 * It can act as a sync source and/or as a sync output, with each component having one sync input
 * and 0 to n sync outputs.
 *
 * SynchronizationComponents are configured via interfaces, which can include PTP, IRIQ, GPS,
 * and CLK sync interfaces, among others.
 *
 * @note Every SynchronizationComponent has at least one interface. Only one interface can be set
 * as an input, while others can be used as sync outputs to synchronize other devices.
 * The configuration of these interfaces and the reading of their status is defined in Part 4.
 *
 * @note Depending on the setup, some interfaces may be switched off, and some interfaces may
 * act as sync sources or outputs.
 *
 * @note A CLK interface can be used to let a device run in Fre-Run mode, where the device
 * syncs internally to an internal quartz.
