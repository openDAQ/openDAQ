= Overview

The openDAQ(TM) provides the following native protocols:

* xref:native_communication_protocol:introduction.adoc[**Native communication protocol specification**]: 
The native communication protocol facilitates data transfer between data acquisition devices and client programs
or gateway devices, minimizing data conversion and optimizing network traffic.
* xref:packet_streaming:overview.adoc[**Packet streaming protocol specification**]: 
The packet streaming protocol encodes openDAQ(TM) packets into a binary format for transmission
across various transport protocols, establishing rules for decoding back into openDAQ(TM) packets on the receiverâ€™s end.

The listed specifications help developers understand the structure, functionality, and implementation details of these protocols.
