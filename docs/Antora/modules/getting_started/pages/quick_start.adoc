= Getting started

This section contains tutorials that serve as a starting point for newcomers to openDAQ(TM). The tutorials focus on setting up your openDAQ(TM) development project and tackle different aspects of openDAQ(TM) development, depending on your needs.

* Setting up (xref:quick_start_setting_up_cpp.adoc[{cpp}]/xref:quick_start_setting_up_python.adoc[Python]) guides you through the initial steps of obtaining the openDAQ(TM) binaries, and configuring your first project that makes use of openDAQ(TM). A guide on xref:quick_start_building_opendaq.adoc[building openDAQ(TM)] from source is also available.
* xref:quick_start_application.adoc[openDAQ(TM) Application Quick Start] guides you through creating an openDAQ(TM) application for retrieving data from an openDAQ(TM) device and can be used as an example for embedding openDAQ(TM) into your application.
