= Setting up ({cpp})

To start working with openDAQ(TM), the requisite binaries are required. They can be obtained
at {docs-website}[the openDAQ(TM) documentation and releases webpage]. The binaries are currently available
for Windows and Ubuntu (20.04 or newer).

[tabs]
====
Windows::
+
--
To install openDAQ(TM), download the `opendaq-2.0.0-win64.exe` installer, run it, and follow its instructions. Make sure
to add openDAQ(TM) to the system path to be able to run openDAQ(TM) application examples.

We recommend using the default installation path to avoid issues requiring additional environment variable modifications
and troubleshooting.

Linux::

To install openDAQ(TM) on Ubuntu 20.04 or newer, download the `opendaq-2.0.0-ubuntu20.04-x86_64.deb` Debian package. Install it
using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
sudo apt install ./opendaq-2.0.0-ubuntu20.04-x86_64.deb

== Creating an openDAQ(TM) project

We start our project from the `"quick_start_app"` example that can be found at the
{docs-website}[openDAQ(TM) documentation and releases webpage]. Download the `examples.zip`
archive and extract it to a folder of choice.

=== Requirements

[tabs]
====
Windows::
+
--

 * CMake (3.20 or newer)
 * CMake generator and {cpp} compiler (Visual Studio 2022 is recommended)
--

Linux::
+
--

 * CMake (3.20 or newer)
 * CMake generator and {cpp} compiler ({gpp} is recommended)

NOTE: Run `sudo apt install cmake build-essential` to install the required tools.

=== Building the project

To build the project, navigate to the `cpp/quick_start` directory and enter the following command
into a terminal or command prompt instance:

[source,shell]
----
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -Bbuild .
----

With this, we are ready to start developing. We fill in our `quick_start_empty.cpp` executable code as follows:

[source,cpp]
----
#include <opendaq/opendaq.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

int main(int argc, const char* argv[])
{
    // Create a fresh openDAQ(TM) instance, which acts as the entry point into our application
    daq::InstancePtr instance = daq::Instance(MODULE_PATH);

    std::cout << "Press \"enter\" to exit the application..." << std::endl;
    std::cin.get();
    return 0;
}
----

When creating the openDAQ(TM) instance, we need to specify the root directory of our openDAQ(TM) Modules.
Conveniently, the CMake configuration pre-filled the correct directory into the `MODULE_PATH` macro definition.

We now compile and run our program.

[tabs]

Windows::

[source,shell]

cd build
cmake --build . --config Release
cd Release
quick_start_empty.exe

cd build
cmake --build .
./quick_start_empty

If you managed to reach this point, you have successfully created your first openDAQ(TM) project! To find
out more about using openDAQ(TM) applications to connect to, configure, and read data of Devices, continue

== Troubleshooting

[tabs]
====
Windows::
+
--
1. If, when running a CMake command, the following error is displayed: "`cmake` is not recognized as an internal or 
   external command, operable program or batch file.", make sure that 
   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2010/ee537574(v=office.14)[CMake is added to the `PATH` environment variable].
2. If openDAQ(TM) is not found when running CMake, create a new environment variable named `openDAQ_ROOT`, with its
   value being the directory where openDAQ(TM) is installed.
3. If the `.dll` shared libraries are not found when running the above example, add the `openDAQ/bin` folder path
   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2010/ee537574(v=office.14)[to the `PATH` environment variable]. The
   `bin` folder is located within the openDAQ(TM) installation folder.
4. If no devices are found when discovering devices, check the `MODULE_PATH` variable if it points to the folder where modules are located. This is usually
   `c:\Program Files\openDAQ\bin\modules`. If not, replace the `MODULE_PATH` with folder string.

1. If the `cmake` command is not found, make sure that the `cmake` executable is located in a folder that is included in your `PATH` environment variable.
2. If openDAQ(TM) is not found when running CMake, export the `openDAQ_ROOT` variable to point at `/opt/opendaq` (`export openDAQ_ROOT=/opt/opendaq`).
3. If the `.so` shared libraries are not found when running the above example, add `/opt/opendaq/lib` to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable
   (`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/opendaq/lib`)
4. If no devices are found when discovering devices, check the `MODULE_PATH` variable if it points to the folder where modules are located. This is usually
   `opt/opendaq/lib/modules`. If not, replace the `MODULE_PATH` with folder string.
