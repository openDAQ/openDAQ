[NOTE]
====
By the end of this guide, learners will be able to:

- 🗝️ Understand basics of access control.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Describe user roles and permissions.
- 🌍 Recognize transport layer authentication.
- 🛡 Understand native protocol access control.
====

In many cases, we have a data acquisition system that can be accessed by multiple users. Typically, we want each user to have specific permissions based on their role.
For instance, an admin user should be able to configure the device and modify all its settings. A guest user might only need read-only access, while a calibrator user
should be able to adjust calibration factors on the device. The openDAQ Access Control system makes this possible.

In an openDAQ device implementation, it is possible to define a list of users that can access it. Each user is a member of one or more user groups. 
When connecting to a device, it is possible to authenticate as one of the defined users. Access to various device components is restricted based on the user's group membership.

NOTE: The authentication and access level enforcement happens at the transport layer level. The openDAQ server authenticates the client, declining requests that the client
does not have access to it.

NOTE: The access control system is available only over the openDAQ "Native protocol".
