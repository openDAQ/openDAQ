= Record Data

:note-caption: Learning Outcomes
[NOTE]
====
By the end of this guide, learners will be able to:

- 📁 Setup Data Recording — Learn how to configure and initialize a CSV data recorder within openDAQ(TM).
- 🔌 Connect Signals — Understand the process of linking specific device signals to recorder input ports.
- ⏯️ Control Data Capture — Master starting and stopping data recording using programmatic control.
- 📊 Data Storage Management — Gain insights into managing the recorded data, including file paths and generated file structures.
- 🛠️ Customization & Extensions — Explore creating custom implementations for recording data beyond numeric scalars, including handling complex signals and alternative storage formats.
====

openDAQ(TM) provides an interface for xref:explanations:components.adoc[Components] which
record data to persistent storage media such as files. The `BasicCsvRecorder` module provides a
simple reference implementation.

[source,cpp]
----
// Create and configure a CSV recorder
auto recorder = instance.addFunctionBlock("BasicCsvRecorder");
recorder.setPropertyValue("Path", "/tmp");

// Connect signal AI0 to the recorder's first input
SignalPtr signal = device.getSignalsRecursive(daq::search::LocalId("AI0"))[0];
auto input1 = recorder.getInputPorts(daq::search::LocalId("Value1"))[0];
input1.connect(signal);

// Record 5 seconds of data
recorder.startRecording();
std::this_thread::sleep_for(5s);
recorder.stopRecording();

The reference implementation supports scalar signals of numeric type. No domain alignment is
performed, and a separate CSV file is generated for each signal. Custom implementations of
`IRecorder` can be designed to support additional file formats or storage media, and to support
more complicated signal types.
