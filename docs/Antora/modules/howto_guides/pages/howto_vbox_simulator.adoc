= Set up an openDAQ(TM) VirtualBox Device simulator

:sdk-docs-website: https://docs.opendaq.com

The openDAQ(TM) VirtualBox image provides a simulated xref:glossary:glossary.adoc#device[Device] that is discoverable by openDAQ(TM), and can be connected to using the openDAQ(TM) client.
The Device itself outputs two sine wave xref:knowledge_base:signals.adoc[Signal]s, with configurable parameters such as the signal amplitude and frequency.

To start, head over to {sdk-docs-website}[The openDAQ(TM) downloads page] and download the simulator image. Within this guide we will be using https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox] to run the simulator.

== Running the simulator

:vm-name: opendaq_device_simulator

. Open VirtualBox and import the .ova simulator image by navigating to "File > Import Appliance".
Select the image file and click "Next > Finish".
. Start the `{vm-name}` image.
. When you see the login screen, the simulator is already running in the background as a service (no login is required).
. However, if you do want to login, the credentials are `User: opendaq`, `Password: opendaq`.

Your virtual machine should look similar to this:

== Running multiple simulators at once

To run multiple simulated xref:glossary:glossary.adoc#device[Device]s at once, for us to be able to connect to them, they must be set up on a separate network adapter:

. Follow <<running_the_simulator,Step 1>> above to import another virtual machine.
. Navigate to VirtualBox "File > Tools > Network manager" and click btn:[Create] to create a new network adapter.
. Open the settings for your 2nd virtual machine, and under "Network > Name" switch the adapter to the newly created one.

You should now be able to discover and connect to both simulators.
