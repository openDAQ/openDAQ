/**
 * Default logger state example
 * 
 * Logger in openDAQ is container how sinks (consumers) and loggerComponents (producers) of logging information,
 * by default their construction and destruction is handled automatically.
 * Default sinks and a component get created in the constructor of an instance.
 * Default sinks can also be constructed separately and added to custom sinks.
 *
 * Configuration of default logging state:
 * - Environment variables:
 *      - OPENDAQ_SINK_CONSOLE_LEVEL -> set the level of logging on the console sink or turn it off
 *      - OPENDAQ_SINK_WINDEBUG_LOG_LEVEL -> set the level of logging on the windows debug or turn it off
 *      - OPENDAQ_SINK_FILE_LOG_LEVEL -> set the level displayed level of logging on the environment provided file sink
 *      - OPENDAQ_SINK_FILE_FILE_NAME -> set the name of the environment provided file sink
 * - Any or all of these sinks can be set to active at the same time
 *
