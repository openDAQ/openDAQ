/**
 * Writing log messages
 * 
 * In openDAQ the recommended way of logging is with the use of macros that allow easy access to every level of logging.
 * They are all made in a pattern of LOG_X, where X represents the initial of the log level
 * (T for trace, D for debug, I for info, W for warning, E for error, C for critical).
 *
 * The level from which the macros are defined is dictated by two variables in CMake configuration of openDAQ.
 * The two variables are:
 *  - OPENDAQ_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG for the debug configuration and
 *  - OPENDAQ_LOG_LEVEL_RELEASE for the release configuration of openDAQ.
 * Macros corresponding to or above (in terms of severity) the level provided in the variable are will log the message
 * contained in the call of the macro itself. Ones below will not log anything instead.
 * (OPENDAQ_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG is set to "Warn", therefore LOG_W, LOG_E and LOG_C will pass on the messages normally, while
 * LOG_T, LOG_D and LOG_I will not do anything).
 * ANY CHANGES TO the CMake VARIABLES REQUIRE a RECONFIGURE and REBUILD of the ENTIRE openDAQ project.
