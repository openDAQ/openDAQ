/**
 * @file    thread_ex.h
 * @author  Toma≈æ Kos
 * @date    16/01/2018
 * @version 1.0
 *
 * @brief ThreadEx is an abstract class that enables creation of separate threads of execution in an application.
 *
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Create a descendant of ThreadEx to represent an execution thread in a multi-threaded application. Each new instance of a TThread
 * descendant is a new thread of execution. Multiple instances of a TThread derived class make an application multi-threaded.
 *
 * Following are issues and recommendations to be aware of when using threads:
 *  - Keeping track of too many threads consumes CPU time
 *  - When multiple threads update the same resources, they must be synchronized to avoid conflicts.
 *  - Most methods that access an object and update a form must only be called from within the main thread or use a synchronization object.
 *
 * Define the thread object's Execute method by inserting the code that should execute when the thread is executed.
